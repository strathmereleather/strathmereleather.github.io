# Strathmere Leather: Understated Luxury

### Luggage, bags, and accessories for the discerning traveler. 

---

## Origin Story

It all started with a weekend escape to Strathmere, New Jersey with my parents, my brother and his family, and my son. It was April, and we went purely for the change of scenery, to be somewhere different.

At this time in my life, I no longer had luggage to pack for the trip. However, I had plenty of leather to choose from, a lot of hardware on hand, all the necessary tools, and a bit of know-how. And so, **The Strathmere Leather Weekend Bag** was born, followed shortly by the **Ocean Front** bag. Both were inspired by the desire to be somewhere else and designed with the understated yet refined aesthetic I have become known for.

Timeless—some may even say rustic. Regardless of how they may be described, each leather good is designed and made by me, Aaron Aiken. Each piece is inspired by my personal life, providing an understated luxury that cannot be found anywhere else.

Own a Strathmere Leather good and join a select group of travelers who value craftsmanship over recognition, and the journey as much as the destination.

Cheers!

~ Aaron M. Aiken

## Coming Soon

> I recently made a smaller travel accessory that I’m going to call **The Jefferson**. Inspired by the simplicity of the Traveler’s Company notebooks and by my out-of-control collection of Field Notes notebooks, **The Jefferson** is my way to carry two or so Field Notes plus a few other inserts. It is now part of my daily routine to use this notebook case as the notebooks are where I write all of my thoughts, ideas, lists, things to do, and also where I keep cash, cards, and so on. It all secures shut with a very simple yet sturdy strap and buckle. I did not build in a solution for securing a pen or pencil, opting instead to let the strap keep that in place. The design of this notebook case falls inline with the look and feel of the other Strathmere Leather goods. Everything coming into its own. Also in progress with this item is a “premium” iteration that is hand-dyed and is, as such, much more refined in look and feel.

> I’m sketching out another bag, working title is **The Franklin**. The intended use is for a future trip I have coming up to Historic Philadelphia. The Strathmere leather weekend bag will be used to pack my clothes and such for the few days there, **The Franklin** will be used to carry the daily items needed when walking from sight to sight. Wandering through museums, seeing the Liberty Bell, walking through Independence Hall, and so on. You get the idea. **The Franklin** will be slung over my shoulder, likely in a cross-body fashion, keeping my pockets empty and a water nearby as we wander the cobblestone streets of yesteryear.

> I’m doing a lackluster job at describing it, the design is still being worked on, but the functionality is pretty straight forward. Easy to access, yet secure, exterior pockets, a sturdy shoulder strap, a phone pocket that is simple to grab and go, an open top that can be shut using snap buttons (I’m quite opposed to zippers), a few suede interior pockets for sunglasses, keys, **The Jefferson**, a water bottle (kept in place using a few ideas I’m working on), etc. The bag dimensions will be approximately 11 inches across, 9 inches tall, ~5 inches in width. A perfectly sized wear it and go bag.
