# Strathmere Leather: Understated Luxury

### Luggage, bags, and accessories for the discerning traveler. 

---

## Origin Story

It all started with a weekend escape to Strathmere, New Jersey with my parents, my brother and his family, and my son. It was April, and we went purely for the change of scenery, to be somewhere different.

At this time in my life, I no longer had luggage to pack for the trip. However, I had plenty of leather to choose from, a lot of hardware on hand, all the necessary tools, and a bit of know-how. And so, **The Strathmere Leather Weekend Bag** was born, followed shortly by the **Ocean Front** bag. Both were inspired by the desire to be somewhere else and designed with the understated yet refined aesthetic I have become known for.

Timeless—some may even say rustic. Regardless of how they may be described, each leather good is designed and made by me, Aaron Aiken. Each piece is inspired by my personal life, providing an understated luxury that cannot be found anywhere else.

Own a Strathmere Leather good and join a select group of travelers who value craftsmanship over recognition, and the journey as much as the destination.

Cheers!

~ Aaron M. Aiken

## Coming Soon

### The Franklin
> I’m sketching out another bag, working title is **The Franklin**. The intended use is for a future trip I have coming up to Historic Philadelphia. The Strathmere leather weekend bag will be used to pack my clothes and such for the few days there, **The Franklin** will be used to carry the daily items needed when walking from sight to sight. Wandering through museums, seeing the Liberty Bell, walking through Independence Hall, and so on. You get the idea. **The Franklin** will be slung over my shoulder, likely in a cross-body fashion, keeping my pockets empty and a water nearby as we wander the cobblestone streets of yesteryear.

> I’m doing a lackluster job at describing it, the design is still being worked on, but the functionality is pretty straight forward. Easy to access, yet secure, exterior pockets, a sturdy shoulder strap, a phone pocket that is simple to grab and go, an open top that can be shut using snap buttons (I’m quite opposed to zippers), a few suede interior pockets for sunglasses, keys, **The Jefferson**, a water bottle (kept in place using a few ideas I’m working on), etc. The bag dimensions will be approximately 11 inches across, 9 inches tall, ~5 inches in width. A perfectly sized wear it and go bag.

### The Galileo
> The Galileo, a passport case (actual tagline TBD). Like Galileo’s pioneering spirit, the passport case is built for practicality and durability while maintaining a sense of elegance and refinement. Galileo’s contributions to navigation and understanding the cosmos inspire the theme of international travel, making The Galileo not just a functional accessory, but a wave (bon voyage!) to the adventurous and curious traveler who values craftsmanship and precision. 

> The Galileo will be made of 100% vegetable tanned leather and will be offered in two standard styles: drum-dyed veg-tan cowhide with Italian suede interior pockets, and hand-dyed calfskin inside and out. The interior of the passport case will feature two primary sections. Pockets on the left side of the case are designed to hold up to 4 cards/cash/etc. This side also features a "flap" pocket designed for easy access to boarding passes and tickets, and is also sized perfectly to store your International Driver Permit (IDP). The front of the case can be customized with a monogram for that extra personal touch.
