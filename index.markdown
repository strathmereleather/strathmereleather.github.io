# Strathmere Leather: Understated Luxury

### Luggage, bags, and accessories for the discerning traveler. 

---

## Origin Story

It all started with a weekend escape to Strathmere, New Jersey with my parents, my brother and his family, and my son. It was April, and we went purely for the change of scenery, to be somewhere different.

At this time in my life, I no longer had luggage to pack for the trip. However, I had plenty of leather to choose from, a lot of hardware on hand, all the necessary tools, and a bit of know-how. And so, **The Strathmere Leather Weekend Bag** was born, followed shortly by the **Ocean Front** bag. Both were inspired by the desire to be somewhere else and designed with the understated yet refined aesthetic I have become known for.

Timeless—some may even say rustic. Regardless of how they may be described, each leather good is designed and made by me, Aaron Aiken. Each piece is inspired by my personal life, providing an understated luxury that cannot be found anywhere else.

Own a Strathmere Leather good and join a select group of travelers who value craftsmanship over recognition, and the journey as much as the destination.

Cheers!

~ Aaron M. Aiken
